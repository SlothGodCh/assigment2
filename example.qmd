1.  Create a new RStudio Project. In this folder, create a simple qmd file called `example.qmd` that can be knitted into a HTML file. Show the result of the knitted file.

## Image Example

Here is an example image:

1.  From the command line interface, initialise this folder as a git repository and push it to the GitHub classroom repository.

In order to initialize git when working in unconncected we have to use git init to initialize git

As shown in the picture we uae git add commit and push to stage and push all files that we have on the file we have now because I was trying to push onto the class repository instead of a repository I had access to I had a bit of a problem as shown:

Now since I have no ownership of the repository no matter how much I tried to cheat Git neither I nor you will succed but you will still get a laugh out of me running around like a headless chicken

2.  Create a new branch called `testbranch`. Modify the file `example.qmd` and add the changes to both the local and remote repositories.

3.  Create a folder called data, and add the data from Assignment 1 to that folder. Amend the previous commit to include the data folder. Push this amended commit to the remote.

4.  Switch back to the main branch and modify `example.qmd` in a different way such that it will conflict with `testbranch`. Commit and push these changes.

5.  Merge the changes in `testbranch` onto `main`. Show the conflict and fixing the merge conflict. Push the changes to GitHub, showing the status and changes in GitHub.

6.  Tag this commit v1.0 on `main` using an annotated tag.

7.  Delete branch `testbranch` locally and on the remote.

8.  Show the commit log in condensed form in the terminal.

9.  On main, create a new section in `example.qmd` that includes an easy to make plot. Commit the changes, and demonstrate using the command line interface how to undo the commit *without* losing your local changes.
